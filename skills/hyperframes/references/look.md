# The look

Left alone, the same brief comes out with the same look run after run. Outside input breaks that: the project's design spec, a real brand, reference images the person gave you, or a preset chosen on purpose. Settle it before the first scene.

## The project's design spec

Read the first of `frame.md`, `design.md`, `DESIGN.md` at the project root that exists; ignore the rest.

- **Frontmatter is normative**: `colors`, `typography`, `spacing`, `components`. Quote hex values, families and weights exactly; never round or invent them.
- **The prose is intent**: what the look is for, Do's and Don'ts. Follow it for judgment, not values.
- **Brand, not layout**: hex, fonts, weight relationships and Do's and Don'ts are strict; type sizes, spacing, border weight and decoration are yours to scale for video. A 1px border or a 6% shadow from a web page vanishes on screen.

## From a brand

- A website: `npx hyperframes capture <url> --json` writes screenshots, the copy (`extracted/visible-text.txt`), images, logos, `extracted/tokens.json` (colours, fonts) and `extracted/design-styles.json` under its output folder. Look at the screenshots before choosing anything. A capture that exits non-zero, prints `ok: false` or writes `BLOCKED.md` failed: take no brand data from its partial files.
- Figma: `npx hyperframes figma tokens <fileKey>` (`/figma`).
- Images the person attached: take palette and type from what you see.

Use the brand's own fonts when the capture shipped their files or they are bundled (`format.md`); otherwise download the family's `.woff2` into `assets/fonts/` with an `@font-face`, or pick the closest bundled family and say so.

## Presets

Each folder in `../assets/frame-presets/` holds a `FRAME.md` spec, a `caption-skin.html` and a `frame-showcase.html` contact sheet. To use one, copy its `FRAME.md` to the project root as `frame.md`, then read it as above; its fonts that aren't bundled need `@font-face` files. The two HTML files are reference code: read them for treatments, never mount them.

## Without a brand or preset

Choose a direction from the subject itself (its era, materials, where it would be shown) and hold it in every scene: palette roles (ground, ink, one accent), a display face and a body face, one rule for the frame.

## Video facts

- Full-screen linear gradients on dark grounds band under H.264; use a radial gradient, a solid fill or a solid plus a local glow.
- An accent at 5% opacity disappears in compression: 15–25% for atmosphere, full saturation for the focal element.

## Make it re-brandable

Declare palette and fonts as variables on the root `<html>` and use them everywhere, so the person can re-brand from Studio's Variables panel:

```html
<html
  data-composition-variables='[
  {"id":"color-ground","type":"color","label":"Background","default":"#ffffff"},
  {"id":"color-ink","type":"color","label":"Text","default":"#101010"},
  {"id":"color-accent","type":"color","label":"Accent","default":"#0055ff"},
  {"id":"font-display","type":"string","label":"Display font","default":"Montserrat"}
]'
></html>
```

Reference them as `var(--color-accent)`; point a registry item's colour and font variables at the same values.
